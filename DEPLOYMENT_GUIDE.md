#### Workspace Issues
**Problem**: "Workspace already exists"
**Solution**: Choose different workspace name or remove existing workspace

**Problem**: "ICS Standards download failed"
**Solution**: Check GitHub access and network connectivity

#### Process Issues
**Problem**: "AI agent created new types without approval"
**Solution**: Stop implementation, create specification for new types, get approval

**Problem**: "Layer boundaries violated"
**Solution**: Review ICS layer architecture standards, refactor code
